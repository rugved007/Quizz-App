# Quiz App
This was a basic quiz app built with C and C++ during my selection process of Teaching Assistant Internship at Internshala.

### Problem Statement

  - The quiz will contain 10 questions asked one at a time.
- These questions will picked up from a file containing 30 questions. Each question will have 4 answers. The user has to choose the correct one. When the user submits his answer, the program will evaluate it against stored answer for the specific question. All the questions will be evaluated in the similar manner and marks will be assigned to the correctly chosen answers.
- At the end it will display the marks that the user has scored.

### Constraints 
1. No question should be repeated.
2. Every time the question sequence should be random.
